WIPSTER on Django (Alpha):

A rebuild of WIPSTER from the ground-up in a modular, cleaner,
faster, leaner, and damn-sexier manner, utilizing the Django framework.

This is completely in its alpha stages, but the raw base functionality currently works.

Just install Django, customize settings.py, python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000,
point your browser to <your-ip>:8000/sanalysis, and you're off and running.

(Long) To-Do List:
- Fuzzy hash comparison
- Search capabilities
- Main landing page
- VirusTotal integration
- Yara integration
- Post-rtfobj.py strings automation
- CRITs integration
- ThreatAnalyzer integration
- Twitter marquee
- Pastebin-checker
- URL-Checking Tools app
- Auto-web-search for indicators

Possibly later on:
- Anubis/Malwr integration?
- Shodan integration?
- ThreatExpert integration?
