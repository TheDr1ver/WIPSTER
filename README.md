WIPSTER on Django (Alpha):

A rebuild of WIPSTER from the ground-up in a modular, cleaner,
faster, and leaner manner, utilizing the Django framework.

This is completely in its alpha stages, but the raw base functionality currently works.

Just install Django, customize settings.py to your liking, run 
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 from the /wipster/ base directory,
point your browser to <your-ip>:8000/sanalysis, and you're off and running.

To-Do List:

- Main landing page
- Yara integration
- Post-rtfobj.py strings automation
- Twitter marquee
- Pastebin-checker
- URL-Checking Tools app
- Auto-web-search for indicators

Possibly later on:
- Anubis/Malwr integration?
- Shodan integration?
- ThreatExpert integration?
